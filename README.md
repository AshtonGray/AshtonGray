Hello! My name is Ashton Gray, and I am an undergraduate senior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

My interests include software for microcontroller systems, cybersecurity, computer networks, and machine learning.
I am project diven with experience in a combination of personal and educational projects, so I hope you enjoy them as much as I did creating them!
